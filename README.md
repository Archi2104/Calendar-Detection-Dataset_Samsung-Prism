# Calendar Detection and Dataset Creation

## Project Overview
The **Calendar Detection and Dataset Creation** project aims to create a dataset of calendar screenshots for detecting and annotating key calendar elements. These include dates, events, empty slots, and navigation buttons.

## Primary Goal
- Collect and annotate calendar screenshots from various platforms:  
   - Mobile Applications  
   - Desktop Applications  
   - Web-based Calendars  

- Identify and mark important components:  
   - **Dates**  
   - **Events**  
   - **Empty Slots**  
   - **Interactive Elements** (e.g., Next/Previous buttons)  

This project will lay the foundation for calendar element detection tasks and future model development.
